# nginx buildpack for Heroku

This buildpack allows you to run nginx on a Heroku dyno.

It has been powering [General Assembly's website](https://generalassemb.ly/) for several years.


## Features

* Downloads and builds nginx 1.11.8 from source
* Downloads and builds MRuby 1.18.8 from source
* Builds nginx with SSL, PCRE, and MRuby extensions
* Caches all builds for lightning-fast deploys

Note: SSL and PCRE packages are [already available](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/cedar-ubuntu-packages) on Heroku, so they don't need to be downloaded before building nginx.


## MRuby

MRuby is a lightweight version of Ruby optimized for use in embedded systems. The `ngx_mruby` module lets you use Ruby as an alternative to Lua for introducing dynamic scripting to nginx.

This blog post offers a taste of what you can do with MRuby in nginx:

## Using this buildpack

After adding the buildpack, `nginx` will be available on your path. But here comes the tricky part: Heroku sends HTTP traffic to a random port on any given dyno, indicated by the `PORT` environment variable. So in order for nginx to receive incoming requests, the `web` process in your `Procfile` needs to do the following:

1. Determine the current port.
1. Dynamically generate an `nginx.conf` file that listens on this port

  ```
  server {
    listen <%= ENV['PORT'] %>;
    ...
  }
  ```
1. Starts nginx with this generated config file

  ```
  nginx -c config/nginx.conf
  ```

Any application using this buildpack must handle all of this itself.


## Development

### Ubuntu

For maximum parity with Heroku's dynos, we recommend using Ubuntu or an Ubuntu virtual machine. See this article for all the details on Heroku's current stack:

### OS X

In OS X, you can `bin/compile` locally like this:

```
BUILD_PREFIX=$PWD ./bin/compile $PWD/build $PWD/cache
```

If you try to build on OS X and have issues related to OpenSSL, make sure you've installed OpenSSL using Homebrew and then you could try the following command:
```
BUILD_PREFIX=$PWD NGINX_OPTIONS="--with-cc-opt=-I$(brew --prefix)/opt/openssl/include --with-ld-opt=-L$(brew --prefix)/opt/openssl/lib" bin/compile $PWD/build $PWD/cache
```
It's not the prettiest, but it _should_ sort out your issues. Basically, it provides an extra option to the nginx compilation which points it to the paths where OpenSSL is located, resolving the errors.


## Credits

This buildpack is based on ryandotsmith's [nginx-buildpack](https://github.com/ryandotsmith/nginx-buildpack). It has since been heavily adapted by General Assembly engineering for internal use. Since then, a ton of amazing features have been added to the original buildpack, so be sure to check that out if you're interested in running nginx on Heroku!
